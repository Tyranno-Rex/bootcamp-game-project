## Features

- **Game Room Management**: Create and manage game rooms for players.
- **User Management**: Handle user registration, authentication, and profiles.
- **Game Progression**: Manage game state and progression.
- **Game Results**: Display results at the end of each game.
- **Ranking System**: Maintain a leaderboard based on player performance.

## In-Game AI

- Implemented AI for non-controlled players to enhance realism and provide a more immersive soccer experience.

## Deployment

Unfortunately, the game was not deployed due to the high resource requirements of Spring Boot on EC2. As students without the budget to purchase a more powerful server, we were unable to deploy the game.
